# Modern P5.js Interactive Website

A visually stunning interactive website built with p5.js, featuring geometric patterns, dynamic text animations, and particle effects.

## Features

- 🎨 Interactive geometric patterns that follow mouse movement and respond to clicks
- ✨ Dynamic color transitions with HSB color mode
- 📝 Morphing text animations
- 🔄 Floating particle effects
- 📱 Fully responsive design
